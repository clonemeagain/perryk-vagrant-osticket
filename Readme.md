# Vagrant - Centos - OsTicket and dev tools

## This project allows vagrant to manage a Centos 7 VM running OsTicket for development.

This differs slightly from a production instance in the following way:

Runs over http instead of https so we don't have to install our certs.
Avoids any production ssh keys.
Has a process to disable all email account checking.
